# Introduction

This is an integration of the OfficeJS Media Player application ([http://mediaplayer.app.officejs.com/](http://mediaplayer.app.officejs.com)) with XWiki. It uses XWiki as a [JIO](http://www.j-io.org) storage and also provides an XWiki extension which embeds the Media Player in an XWiki page.
